 # network Analysis -Markov Algorithm 
 <br>Marshood Ayoub  ([Marshood](https://github.com/Marshood).) <br>

 First thing we do to create a network using makeNetwork.m, the network we created with 2694 nodes and 94 clusters.
Note:  The clustering algorithm I wrote will be in the file MCL.m and the network in the file HW2Net1.NET
Also, the clustering algorithm with different parameters in the files MCLe*r*.clu, Instead * will be listed the value of the parameters
Note: To check the Markov algorithm in file MCL.m and compile the code, you can change the two parameters R, E in lines 13-14, and the number of the node's and the cluster's in line 11-12
Note: The images are saved in order from the first to the end are counted by serial number for example: Pic1, Pic2, â€¦, PicN
The first picture Pic1:
